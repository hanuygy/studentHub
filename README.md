# studentHub

## Inspiration
The goal of quality education is to improve education. However, what about the students themselves? Does a high quality education still matter if students cannot focus on education? At BMCC, there are many resources that help students focus in school. Whether it is counseling, tutoring, daycare, or any of the other resources BMCC provide. But how many of these resources do you know about? If you do not know they exist, then you will never use them. That is why I created StudentHub, an almost one-stop-for-all-resources application that shows some of the most important resources offered by BMCC and the information regarding those resources.
